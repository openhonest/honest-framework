# Spec-Conformance Audit — current tree

Date: 2026-07-08
Method: one read-only audit agent per module, each comparing the committed
implementation under `python/` (and `javascript/` for honest-DOM) against its
governing spec under `specs/`. Every load-bearing "MISSING" verdict below was
then re-verified by direct `grep`/read against the source, not taken on the
agent's word.

Supersedes the 2026-06-15 `c281f2d` snapshot (which predates the module rebuilds
and is no longer accurate — it recorded honest-type at ~2/60 requirements; it is
now 60/60). That snapshot triggered the spec-first rebuild; this one measures how
far the rebuild has come.

## Why this audit exists — the trust failure it corrects

I repeatedly reported modules as "complete." What I actually meant was
"passes the gate": honest-check clean + 100% line/branch coverage + value oracle
+ mutation adequacy + feature bijection. **That gate proves internal
self-consistency of the code that was written. It does not prove the code
implements the spec.** Two reasons, both verified:

1. **Coverage is circular against the spec.** 100% line+branch coverage is 100%
   of the lines that *exist*, not 100% of the behaviours the spec *requires*. A
   module that implements a third of its spec can be 100% covered.

2. **The feature bijection is circular against the spec.** The self-check pairs
   one gherkin scenario to one function point — it catches an orphan function or
   an orphan scenario. It does **not** check the feature file against the spec,
   and the feature files are authored *from the code*. honest-DOM's own feature
   file says so at `javascript/honest-dom/features/honest-dom.feature:2-4`: "One
   scenario per function point: **the named functions of the JavaScript reference
   implementation.**" A spec requirement that never became a function never
   became a scenario, so the bijection is blind to it.

3. **Even the function→gherkin half is not mechanically enforced right now.**
   honest-check correctly defers HC-P008/009/012 to honest-test (spec §4.3), but
   honest-test never implemented HC-P009 detection — it exists only in a
   docstring (`honest-test/src/honest_test/coverage_data.py:1`). So *nothing*
   currently fails a build when a roled function has no gherkin. The "one gherkin
   per function point" invariant I kept citing is maintained by hand, not by a
   check.

The durable fix is a third traceability edge — **spec-requirement →
feature-scenario**, enforced so a numbered spec requirement with no scenario
fails the way an orphan function does today. This audit is the manual stand-in
for that missing check, and its per-module requirement lists are the seed
registry that edge needs.

## Per-module verdict

Verdicts use three honest categories:

- **SPEC-COMPLETE** — every normative requirement implemented; remaining spec
  sections are explicitly other tools (honest-check/honest-test) by the spec's
  own words.
- **COMPLETE AT MANDATE** — the module's own mandate is fully implemented; the
  unmet "Full/Complete" conformance levels require host-framework / boundary /
  application code the spec *intentionally* does not ship in this package.
- **SUBSET** — the implementation is a genuine partial of its own spec. These are
  the modules I wrongly called "complete."

| Module | Category | Fraction (by requirement) | Worst verified gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| honest-type | **SPEC-COMPLETE** | 60/60 | none |
| honest-errors | **SPEC-COMPLETE** | 27/27 | none |
| honest-gherkin | **SPEC-COMPLETE** | 13/13 | none |
| honest-features | **COMPLETE AT MANDATE** | 9/9 lib functions | Full/Complete need app-layer routes/CLI (spec §11 defers) |
| honest-state | **COMPLETE AT MANDATE** | 15/18 | law+taxonomy complete; no conformance test that the §3 honest-check rules actually fire |
| honest-auth | **SUBSET** | ~11/28 (~39%) | `test_token_generator.generate()` contract wrong/absent; no 6-token-class enforcement; no conformance-suite app; `"unauthenticated"` fault key not enforced |
| honest-check | **SUBSET** | ~36/42 rules; ~85% Py, ~70% JS | HC001 boundary-vocabulary derivation is a stub; HC011 predicate sampling absent; JS watch-lists ~half |
| honest-observe | **SUBSET** | ~39/46 (85%) | `hf.proof.checked` builder absent; 6/13 built-in metrics missing; OTel auth attrs + `install_otel_exporter` absent |
| honest-test | **SUBSET** | ~65% | no runner/CLI; no BDD step scaffolding; no `io_monitor` (§4.4); HC-P009 not implemented; §6/§7 absent |
| honest-parse | **SPEC-COMPLETE** | 6/6 languages | none (Ruby/PHP/Go/Elixir added — commit f793594) |
| honest-persist | **SUBSET** | SQLite/Turso substantial; Postgres non-functional | no PostgreSQL inspector; no view/trigger/procedure DDL apply; no RETURNING; no materialized-view refresh |
| honest-alerts | **SUBSET** | schema/pure 100%; runtime 0% | no expiry/escalation pollers, no channel handlers, no SSE, no threshold sends — schema+validator layer only |
| honest-DOM | **SUBSET** | ~45% of Full | injected-param signatures with no browser-binding wrapper; §4 React hooks absent; §5 observability absent; conformance suite has 3 cases |

Score: of 13 modules, **4 spec-complete, 2 complete-at-mandate, 7 genuine subsets.**

Remediation is proceeding in the spec's bootstrap/dependency order
(`specs/01-framework/honest-framework-spec.md` §299): parse → check → test →
observe → persist → auth → state → features → DOM → alerts. Completed: **parse**
(2026-07-08).

(Tier 3 honest-components and honest-page have specs but are not yet built in
this tree, so they are outside this audit's scope; they were never reported
complete.)

## Per-module detail

### honest-type — SPEC-COMPLETE (60/60)
Reserved words (all three layers), Set∩Set overlap, composed types with
requires/captures and no-ambiguity, maybe/Nothing, the two-pass classify
algorithm (all phases), tickets/rejections/manifest/fault schemas, chains
(sync/async/compose), state machines, and the catch-all sampling guard
(`_check_catch_all`, deterministic corpus, >95% reject) are all present and
correct. honest-check and honest-test are separate specs by design.

### honest-errors — SPEC-COMPLETE (27/27)
Both normalizers produce one `ExceptionReport` shape; faults-as-data; no hidden
I/O (environment/timestamp/now all injected); four frozen vocabularies; dict
dispatch not ladders; pure throttle returning `(decision, new_state)`; boundary
conditions exact (`<` not `<=`, 3600s hour). No gaps.

### honest-gherkin — SPEC-COMPLETE (13/13)
IR TypedDicts, faults-as-data (no `raise` off the boundary), bounded
vocabularies, fold semantics with immutable context stopping at first non-ok,
no global registration, exception classification table, single I/O boundary in
`cli.py`. All four prototype divergences (§11) fixed.

### honest-features — COMPLETE AT MANDATE (9/9 library functions)
`validate_vocabulary`, `initial_state`, `feature_state`, `validate_toggle`,
`apply_toggle`, `build_signature`, `verify_signature` (constant-time compare,
replay window), `changed_event`, `evaluated_event` all present and pure. The
"missing" pieces — `load_secret`, the toggle route, the A/B middleware, the CLI
caller — are assigned to the application/boundary by spec §11, and HF001/HF002
are honest-check's. Legitimately deferred, but it means **Full/Complete
conformance is not met by this package alone**.

### honest-state — COMPLETE AT MANDATE (15/18)
The single-mutator law (`second_mutator_legitimate`) and the nine-kind taxonomy
with one mutator each are complete and tested. The gaps are integration-facing:
honest-state names the §3 honest-check rules that enforce the law but provides
no reference to them, and there is **no conformance test that those rules
actually fire on a planted violation** — only that the law's truth-table holds.
Its own mandate ("define the law and the taxonomy; primitives live in home
modules") is met.

### honest-auth — SUBSET (~39%)
The AuthProvider TypedDict (five fields), the pure value-registry
(`empty_registry`/`register_auth_provider`/`registered_provider`, immutable),
`authenticate()` boundary dispatch, and `fault_status()` mapping are implemented
and pure. Verified gaps:
- **`test_token_generator` contract is wrong** — spec §2.4 requires
  `.generate(class, context) → Token`; the impl carries only a `Callable` with a
  `(class_name) → token` comment and no `.generate()`; honest-test cannot drive it.
- **No enforcement of the six token classes** (valid/revoked/expired/malformed/
  missing/forged) a provider must produce.
- **No conformance-suite app** (§9.2 `honest/honest-auth-conformance/` synthetic
  boundary) — only portable value cases exist.
- **`"unauthenticated"` fault-mapping key not enforced** (§2.5/§4.5 require it
  always present); a provider with `fault_mapping: {}` registers successfully.
- Conformance metadata is `[tool.honest-check]`, not the spec's
  `[honest-auth-provider]`.
Much of what remains (domain-mutation prevention, determinism, boundary
placement) is correctly deferred to honest-check/honest-test/host, per
[[auth-is-boundary-validation]]; the contract-shape gaps above are the real ones.

### honest-check — SUBSET (~85% Python, ~70% JavaScript)
36 of 36 statically-verifiable rules are implemented for Python; test-time rules
(HC-P008/009/012) are correctly deferred. Verified gaps:
- **HC001** does not derive the first link's boundary vocabulary from the route
  map (spec §4.2); it only checks a `@link` exists. This weakens the
  "guaranteed complete auto-generated suite" claim.
- **HC011** predicate sampling (1000 strings, reject >95%) is **not in
  `rules.py`** — verified by grep. It emits info and defers. (The sampling that
  exists is honest-type's construction-time guard, a different mechanism.)
- **JavaScript watch-lists ~half complete** — missing I/O and nondeterminism
  entries (WebSocket, XMLHttpRequest, `fs/promises.*`, `process.env`,
  `navigator.*`, `document.cookie`, …), so impure JS can pass.
- `pyproject.toml` declares `conformance = "python"`, not a valid level.

### honest-observe — SUBSET (~85%)
Event envelope, `emit()`, all 11 framework event builders, projections +
snapshots, HLC ingest + identity binding + rejection log, threshold projections,
and dev-tool formatting are implemented. Verified gaps:
- **`hf.proof.checked` builder absent** (§4.8) — exists only as a comment
  pointing elsewhere; blocks the honest-test certification matrix on the
  observe side.
- **6 of 13 built-in metrics missing** (4 persist-related, deferred with
  rationale; 2 per-link blocked on an undefined firing rule).
- OTel **auth attributes** and **`install_otel_exporter`** absent.
- No development-mode config.

### honest-test — SUBSET (~65%)
Strong: the generation engine (Set enumeration, Fibonacci numerics,
length-bounded, adversarial classes 1–4), the value oracle + step library,
purity/mutation/idempotency/chain-contract/auth-honesty checks, state-machine
test generation, the four coverage measures, and the full mutation-operator set.
Verified gaps:
- **No runner/CLI** — no `honest-test` command; the whole execution/output layer
  (§11) is absent (only the conformance harness exists).
- **No BDD step scaffolding generator** (§8.2) and **no HTTP assertion step
  library** (§8.4).
- **No `io_monitor`** (§4.4 boundary isolation) — cannot detect undeclared I/O.
- **HC-P009 not implemented** — the "one gherkin per roled function" detector is
  a docstring only. This is the check that would have caught un-authored
  features; it does not run.
- §6 (persist contract tests) and §7 (component isolation) absent.

### honest-parse — SPEC-COMPLETE (6 of 6 languages) — resolved 2026-07-08 (f793594)
The parse boundary and node helpers (`node_text`, `line_col`, `walk`,
`first_error_node`, UTF-8, determinism) were already correct. All six framework
target languages are now present in `_LANGUAGES` — Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP
(via the tag-aware `language_php()` handle), Go, Elixir — each a single row plus a
convenience wrapper. The JS law and the four new grammars are checked uniformly by
a data-driven `_law_grammars` table over per-language corpora; the closed-vocabulary
law exercises all six; portable suite cases cover each. Gate: honest-check clean,
100% coverage, 28 conformance cases + 8 laws, mutation 65 caught / 0 undeclared,
bijection 11 = 11.

### honest-persist — SUBSET (SQLite/Turso substantial; Postgres non-functional)
Present and solid: schema diff/validate/deps/ambiguity, apply with table
reconstruction + FK lifecycle + Turso sync-pause, the **full abstraction
backfill** (enum/range/array/map/hierarchy via `expand_schema`), CHECK
parse+compile+enforce, the pool (routing/lifecycle/events), connect-with-retry,
the durable write-queue + supervisor, transactions, cutover, Pydantic + Django
loaders, and the full instrumentation event set. Verified gaps:
- **No PostgreSQL inspector** — `_INSPECTORS = {"sqlite": …, "turso": …}` only;
  `migrate()` on Postgres gets `None`. **Postgres does not work end-to-end**,
  despite being a declared dialect.
- **No view/trigger/procedure DDL renderers** in `apply.py._RENDERERS` — `diff()`
  detects those changes but `apply()` cannot execute them (§5.7 half-built).
- No RETURNING; no materialized-view refresh; FK `on_delete`/`on_update` parsed
  but not emitted; live introspection reads only columns.
- Beyond-spec (would need spec additions to reach declaro parity): upsert,
  atomic increment, bulk insert, complex WHERE, the three ORM query styles.

### honest-alerts — SUBSET (schema/validator layer only; no runtime)
Complete and correct: all schemas and validators (actors, message, termination,
routing, escalation-rule), the mailbox projection and `is_terminated` dispatch,
the lifecycle state machine, the supervisor's pure routing + delivery-plan
construction, surface rendering, and the event catalog. Verified gaps — the
entire runtime:
- **Expiry/escalation pollers do not exist** — referenced only in a comment
  (`events.py:19`); `alert.expired` is never emitted, so messages cannot expire.
- **Escalation never fires** — the validator exists; nothing acts on
  `escalation_ttl`.
- **No channel handlers** (email/SMS/webhook/Slack/Teams); `execute_deliveries`
  calls an injected `runtime.deliver` that has no implementation.
- **No SSE stream** and **no reply endpoint wiring**, so `send_and_wait` cannot
  complete.
- No threshold-triggered sends.
Actual level reached: **Core schema/validation only** — not even Core behaviour,
because `alert.expired` cannot be emitted.

### honest-DOM — SUBSET (~45% of Full)
The seven core functions and the HTMX extension have correct *logic*. Verified
gaps:
- **Signature mismatch with no bridge.** Every function takes injected boundary
  params (`query`, `bus`, `deps`) instead of the spec's parameter-free
  signatures, and **the browser-binding wrapper that would reach
  `document`/`localStorage`/`fetch`/`MutationObserver`/`sendBeacon` does not
  exist.** Callers cannot use the exported API directly against a real browser.
- **§4 React hooks absent** (`useDomState`/`useDomValue`/`useDomArray`/`useDomMap`).
- **§5 browser observability absent** — no `emitBrowserEvent`, no `sendBeacon`,
  no request_id threading, none of the four automatic events, no privacy mode.
- Portable conformance suite has 3 cases (shortcuts only) vs the ~30 the spec
  implies.

## What "complete" must mean from here

A module is **complete** only when every numbered spec requirement is
implemented *and* gated — not when the built subset passes the gate. Until the
spec→feature edge is mechanical, each module carries an explicit conformance
line naming which spec requirements are met, which are deferred-by-design (and to
where), and which are genuinely unbuilt. "Passes the gate" is reported as exactly
that, never as "complete."
